# cilib

[cilib](https://github.com/ciren/cilib) was created by [Edwin Peer](https://up-za.academia.edu/EdwinPeer) for his PhD thesis at the University of Pretoria: `Typesafe, purely functional Computational Intelligence`. The license used was initially GPL 3.0, but relicensed it after 5 years to the Apache License. It's currently maintained by [Gary Pampar√†](https://github.com/gpampara).

Edwin drafted a letter to the university requesting them to give up the rights to the software. The university was happy with the GPL license, although Edwin had to appeal twice for them to agree.
